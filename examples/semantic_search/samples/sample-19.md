# Article 19: Edge Computing Security Challenges

Edge computing brings data processing closer to end users and devices, improving performance but creating new security challenges. Distributed edge nodes have limited security controls compared to centralized data centers. Attack surfaces expand across numerous endpoints with varying security capabilities. Key concerns include device authentication, data encryption, secure updates, and centralized security management. Zero-trust architectures and hardware-based security become essential for edge deployments.
