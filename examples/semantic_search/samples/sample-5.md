# Article 5: Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning

Supervised learning uses labeled training data to predict outcomes for new inputs, including classification and regression tasks. Common algorithms include decision trees, support vector machines, and random forests. Unsupervised learning discovers hidden patterns in unlabeled data through clustering, dimensionality reduction, and association rules. Semi-supervised learning combines both approaches when labeled data is scarce. Each paradigm serves different problem types and data availability scenarios.
