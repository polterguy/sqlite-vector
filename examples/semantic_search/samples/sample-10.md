# Article 10: Zero Trust Security Architecture

Zero trust security operates on the principle of "never trust, always verify," requiring authentication and authorization for every access request regardless of location. This approach assumes breach scenarios and implements continuous verification throughout the network. Key components include identity verification, device compliance checking, least privilege access, and micro-segmentation. Zero trust frameworks help organizations protect against insider threats and advanced persistent attacks.
