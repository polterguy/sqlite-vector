# Article 6: AI Ethics and Bias Mitigation

Artificial intelligence systems can perpetuate or amplify human biases present in training data, leading to unfair outcomes across different demographic groups. Bias mitigation strategies include diverse dataset collection, algorithmic fairness constraints, and regular bias auditing. Ethical AI development requires transparency, accountability, and stakeholder involvement. Organizations must establish governance frameworks addressing privacy, consent, and algorithmic decision-making impacts on individuals and society.
