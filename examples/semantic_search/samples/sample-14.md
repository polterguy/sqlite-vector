# Article 14: AI-Driven Security Orchestration

Security orchestration platforms integrate multiple security tools and automate incident response workflows using artificial intelligence. These systems correlate alerts from various sources, prioritize threats based on risk assessment, and execute automated remediation actions. Natural language processing helps analyze threat intelligence reports, while machine learning improves decision-making accuracy over time. Orchestration reduces response times and analyst workload while maintaining consistent security procedures.
