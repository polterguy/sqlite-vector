# Article 20: IoT Security Vulnerabilities

Internet of Things devices often have weak security controls due to cost constraints and rapid deployment cycles. Common vulnerabilities include default passwords, unencrypted communications, lack of update mechanisms, and insufficient access controls. IoT botnets can launch massive distributed denial-of-service attacks. Security strategies include network segmentation, device lifecycle management, security-by-design principles, and regulatory compliance requirements for IoT manufacturers and deployments.
