# Article 18: Quantum Computing and Cryptography

Quantum computing poses both opportunities and threats for cybersecurity. Quantum computers could break current cryptographic algorithms like RSA and ECC that secure internet communications and data protection. Organizations must prepare for post-quantum cryptography by implementing quantum-resistant algorithms. However, quantum technologies also enable quantum key distribution for theoretically unbreakable communication channels. The transition period requires careful planning and gradual migration strategies.
