# Article 15: Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)

Advanced persistent threats represent sophisticated, long-term cyberattacks typically conducted by nation-states or organized criminal groups. APTs use multiple attack vectors, maintain persistent access, and employ stealth techniques to avoid detection. Common tactics include spear-phishing, zero-day exploits, living-off-the-land techniques, and lateral movement within networks. Defense requires continuous monitoring, threat hunting, and intelligence-driven security strategies to detect and neutralize these patient adversaries.
