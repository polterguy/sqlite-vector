# Article 11: Incident Response and Recovery

Effective incident response requires predefined procedures for detecting, containing, and recovering from security breaches. Response teams follow structured phases: preparation, identification, containment, eradication, recovery, and lessons learned. Critical activities include forensic analysis, stakeholder communication, system restoration, and process improvement. Regular tabletop exercises and response plan updates ensure organizations can quickly minimize damage and restore normal operations after security incidents.
