# Article 8: AI Regulation and Compliance

Governments worldwide are developing regulatory frameworks for artificial intelligence deployment and development. The European Union's AI Act categorizes AI systems by risk levels, imposing strict requirements for high-risk applications. Compliance involves documentation, risk assessment, human oversight, and algorithmic auditing. Organizations must navigate evolving regulations while maintaining innovation capabilities. Privacy laws like GDPR also impact AI data processing and automated decision-making systems.
