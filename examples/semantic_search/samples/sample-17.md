# Article 17: Supply Chain Security Risks

Supply chain attacks target third-party vendors and software dependencies to compromise multiple organizations simultaneously. Attackers may insert malicious code into legitimate software updates, compromise hardware during manufacturing, or exploit trusted vendor relationships. Notable incidents include SolarWinds and Kaseya attacks affecting thousands of organizations. Mitigation strategies include vendor risk assessment, software composition analysis, and zero-trust principles for third-party integrations.
