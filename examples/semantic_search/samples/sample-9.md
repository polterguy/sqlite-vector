# Article 9: Threat Detection and Prevention

Cybersecurity threat detection employs various technologies to identify malicious activities before they cause damage. Intrusion detection systems monitor network traffic for suspicious patterns, while endpoint protection software guards individual devices. Behavioral analysis identifies anomalies in user activities that may indicate compromised accounts. Security information and event management (SIEM) platforms aggregate and analyze security logs from multiple sources to provide comprehensive threat visibility.
