# Article 16: Social Engineering Attack Vectors

Social engineering exploits human psychology rather than technical vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to systems and information. Common techniques include phishing emails, pretexting phone calls, baiting with infected media, and physical tailgating. Attackers research targets through social media and public information to craft convincing scenarios. Defense requires security awareness training, verification procedures, and creating organizational cultures that encourage reporting suspicious communications.
